B-bet3.0 - React edition

B-bet is a platform to predict NFL games for my friends and me. After writing 1.0 in PHP,
2.0 with Django it's time to step it up. This Project is mainly a learning opportunity for me to
get more familiar with React, Typescript and Tailwindcss. Furthermore, the backend will be implemented 
in PHP with Symfony.
